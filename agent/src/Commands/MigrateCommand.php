     * The history that tracks NightOwl's migrations has lived in different places
     * across versions: in the nightowl database (v1.0.0–1.0.10, via
     * `--database=nightowl`), then in the host app's primary database
     * (v1.0.11–1.0.12), and now back in the nightowl database. So a given install
     * may have a complete, partial/stale, or empty nightowl-side history, with
     * the rest recorded in the primary database.
     *
     * We record into the nightowl history every migration that's already applied
     * according to EITHER history but isn't tracked here yet. That covers all the
     * upgrade paths without recreating existing tables, while leaving genuinely
     * unapplied migrations for migrate to run. A fresh database (no tables) needs
     * nothing. If the tables exist but neither history knows anything, we adopt
     * the schema as-is and say so — a genuinely-missing migration can't be
     * detected in that case.
